# Whiplash - Sheldon's Whip Application

### This is dedicated to Big Bang Theory S5 E19. 
A whip application on a mobile device was used at various times in the episode as a humor prop. 
The characters would "whip" as a way to mock the other characters who were being controlled by their significant others.
I found it quite hilarous and decided to make an iOS app out of it.

So... WHIPASHHHHHHH....!
